# Bike Buyers Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting bike purchases using a dataset of bike buyers. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning models.

## Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load dataset and perform initial exploration.
   - Display basic statistics and value counts for categorical features.

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Plot histograms and boxplots to examine distributions and detect outliers.

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Create scatter plots and pairplots to analyze relationships between features and bike purchases.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Encode categorical features and perform data sampling.

5. **EDA**
   - Visualize bike purchase trends across different demographic features.

6. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encode categorical variables and compute dissimilarity matrices.

7. **Modeling**
   - Build and evaluate decision tree and random forest models.
   - Visualize decision trees and assess model performance with classification metrics and ROC curves.

8. **Logistic Regression**
   - Fit a logistic regression model and visualize feature coefficients.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Results
- Insightful visualizations of bike purchase patterns.
- Effective prediction models using decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression.
